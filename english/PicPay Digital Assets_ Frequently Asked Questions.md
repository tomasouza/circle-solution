## General Questions

### What is USDC and how does it differ from other cryptocurrencies?
USDC (USD Coin) is a fully-reserved digital dollar stablecoin issued by Circle. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, USDC is designed to maintain a stable value pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Each USDC is backed by cash and short-dated U.S. government obligations, ensuring stability and transparency. USDC is regularly audited by major accounting firms to verify its reserves.

### Why is Circle the right partner for PicPay's digital asset strategy?
Circle is a global financial technology company with a proven track record in digital currency infrastructure. As the issuer of USDC, Circle has over $50 billion in circulation and processes millions of transactions monthly. Circle's regulated status, compliance focus, and enterprise-grade APIs make it an ideal partner for PicPay. Additionally, Circle's recent partnership with Matera in Brazil demonstrates their commitment to the Brazilian market.

### How does this solution benefit PicPay users?
PicPay users will benefit from faster international transfers (minutes vs. days), lower fees (up to 50% reduction), seamless global payments, and the ability to hold US dollar-denominated assets as a hedge against currency fluctuations. The solution also provides a unified experience within the PicPay app, eliminating the need to use multiple services for international transactions.

## Technical Questions

### How does the Circle Mint API work?
The Circle Mint API enables the conversion between fiat currencies and USDC. When a user converts BRL to USDC, PicPay's backend calls the Circle Mint API, which mints new USDC tokens and transfers them to the designated wallet. The process is reversed for USDC to BRL conversion. The API uses secure authentication, idempotency keys to prevent duplicate transactions, and provides detailed transaction status information.

### What blockchains will USDC run on in this implementation?
Initially, the implementation will support USDC on Ethereum and Polygon. Ethereum provides the highest level of security and adoption, while Polygon offers lower transaction fees and faster confirmation times. In Phase 3, we plan to expand to additional blockchains like Solana and Avalanche to provide more options and optimize for different use cases.

### How will the integration handle exchange rate fluctuations?
The system will use real-time exchange rates from Circle's API, which aggregates rates from multiple liquidity providers. To protect users from volatility during the transaction process, we'll implement a brief rate lock period (30 seconds) during which the quoted rate is guaranteed. For larger transactions, we'll also provide rate alerts and optional limit orders to execute conversions when desired rates are reached.

### What APIs and endpoints will be used for the integration?
The primary APIs include:
- Circle Mint API: `/v1/businessAccount/transfers` for minting and redeeming USDC
- Cross-Currency API: `/v1/transfers` for international transfers
- Payments API: `/v1/payments` for merchant payment processing
- Additional endpoints for wallet management, transaction history, and account information

## Regulatory Questions

### How does this solution comply with Brazilian regulations?
The solution is designed to comply with Law 14.478/22, which established the legal framework for virtual assets in Brazil. PicPay will register as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) with the Central Bank of Brazil. The implementation leverages PicPay's existing KYC/AML infrastructure, which already meets regulatory requirements. Circle's compliance team will provide ongoing support to ensure adherence to evolving regulations.

### What KYC/AML procedures will be implemented?
The solution will utilize PicPay's existing KYC/AML procedures, which include identity verification, address verification, and ongoing transaction monitoring. Additional measures specific to digital assets will include:
- Risk-based transaction limits
- Enhanced due diligence for high-value transactions
- Blockchain analytics integration to monitor for suspicious activities
- Automated reporting for regulatory compliance

### How will tax reporting be handled for users?
PicPay will provide users with comprehensive transaction reports that include all USDC transactions, conversions, and relevant exchange rates. These reports will be designed to facilitate tax reporting in accordance with Brazilian tax regulations. Additionally, we'll develop educational content to help users understand their tax obligations related to digital assets.

### Are there any regulatory restrictions on USDC usage in Brazil?
Currently, Brazil has a progressive regulatory framework for digital assets. The Central Bank of Brazil recognizes stablecoins as payment instruments, allowing their use for payments and transfers. There are no specific restrictions on USDC usage, but users must comply with general financial regulations, including tax reporting and anti-money laundering provisions.
